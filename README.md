### Description

This code generates an MD5 protected string, which can be used to hand off to other web pages, or even other sites. If someone can read the ticket, they can use it, so this works best over encrypted connections, but since the ticket only lasts for a short time (2 hours, definable) I think it's better than sending a password around.
